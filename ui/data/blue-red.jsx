            You’re highest in TWO colours - red and blue.
            <br />
            <br />
            These are two very different natures and you’ve got both in you.
            <br />
            <br />
            The blue suggests you’re super- sensitive to other people’s feelings while the red suggests you’re direct, fair and very competitive.
            <br />
            <br />
            You can be hard and soft, and know when it’s to give a cuddle or a kick in the pants! This is a great combination because it involves both the head and the heart when communicating, but it can create confusion with other people when you jump from being the the listener to the director.
            <br />
            <br />
            Do you find that sometimes you want to be harsh with people but you just won’t let yourself go there? Or do you sometimes speak the truth but feel bad about it later?
            <br />
            <br />
            Which one is the strongest in you and how does the relationship between the two
            colours affect your
            day to day communication - and life - professionally and personally?
            <br />

            Please bear in mind that this is only a quick quiz, and your results may differ when
            you do the full
            flames assessment. In that you’ll learn your 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th flame colour, how
            they affect each
            other and most importantly your own strength and weaknesses.
