        Hi, well aren’t you clever?

        <p className="m-0 leading-6">
            You’re highest in TWO colours - blue and clear.
            <br />
            <br />
            These are two very different natures and you’ve got both in you.
            <br />
            <br />
            The blue suggests you’re super- sensitive to other people’s feelings while the clear
            suggests you are strong on details and deadlines.
            <br />
            <br />
            This combination suggests that you are an incredibly ‘alert’ person who notices far
            more detail and nuance than many around you.
            <br />
            <br />
            This is a great combination because it involves both the head and the heart when
            communicating, and means you can communicate with incredible empathy and almost
            supernatural acuity!
            <br />
            <br />
            This combination is one of the toughest however, because while you set an incredibly
            high standard, you often feel you can never meet that standard yourself.
            <br />
            <br />
            Which one is the strongest in you and how does the relationship between the two
            colours affect your
            day to day communication - and life - professionally and personally?
            <br />

            they affect each
            other and most importantly your own strength and weaknesses.
