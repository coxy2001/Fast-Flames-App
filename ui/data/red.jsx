            Hi,
        </h1>
        <p className="m-0 leading-6">
            Thank you. According to the 15 fast flames quiz, you’re highest in red, initially indicating that your
            strongest nature is the Efficient.
            <br />
            <br />
            This nature is loyal, strong and driven. You’ll find the most practical and logical way to do things,
            and will set about working in a no-nonsense way.
            <br />
            <br />
            Emotions are nice, but can’t be relied on like cold, hard facts. Would it be fair to suggest you’re
            quite competitive?
            <br />
            <br />
            Those with loads of red can make the hard decisions, can say no and make excellent managers, teachers
            and high court judges.
            <br />
            <br />
            BUT - your direct manner and quiet communication style can lead to problems in your professional life
            and your personal relationships.
            <br />
            <br />
            Please bear in mind that this is only a quick quiz, and your results may differ when you do the full
            flames assessment. In that you’ll learn your 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th flame colour, how they affect each
            other and most importantly your own strength and weaknesses. Keen to try more?
