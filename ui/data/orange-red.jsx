            You’re highest in TWO colours - orange and red.
            <br />
            <br />
            These are two very different natures and you’ve got both in you.
            <br />
            <br />
            The orange suggests you’re creative, a big picture thinker, fun loving and positive, while the red
            suggests you’re direct, fair and very competitive.
            <br />
            <br />
            This is a great combination because it involves both the head and the heart when communicating, but it
            can create confusion with other people when you jump from being the party animal to the fun police.
            <br />
            <br />
            You’re ambitious, driven and will work extremely hard to get a great result, but you can get quietly
            irritated when things don’t seem fair. Boy, you’re great in an argument?
            <br />
            <br />
            Which one is the strongest in you and how does the relationship between the two colours affect your
            day to day communication - and life - professionally and personally?
            <br />
            <br />
            Please bear in mind that this is only a quick quiz, and your results may differ when you do the full
            flames assessment. In that you’ll learn your 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th flame colour, how they affect each
            other and most importantly your own strength and weaknesses.
