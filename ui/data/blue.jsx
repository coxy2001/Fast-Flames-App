            Hi,
        </h1>
        <p className="m-0 leading-6">
            thank you so much for trying our quiz, I really hope you enjoyed it.
            <br />
            <br />
            According to the 15 fast flames quiz, you’re highest in blue, initially indicating that your nature is what we call the Natural.
            <br />
            <br />
            This part of us enjoys other people’s company, is very intuitive and cares deeply about other people’s feelings. While you may be a sensitive sort, you are definitely not weak.
            <br />
            <br />
            Those with loads of blue in their nature make wonderful teachers, diplomats, managers and enjoy tasks that are more ‘hands on’, rather than those that require loads of analysis and abstract thought.
            <br />
            <br />
            Naturals care, want to be happy and safe and feelings are paramount. BUT - being a ‘magnet’ for other people’s feelings can weigh you down, and sometimes shuts you down too.
            <br />
            <br />
            This can lead to problems in your professional life and your personal relationships. Please bear in mind that this is only a quick quiz, and your results may differ when you do the full flames assessment.
            <br />
            <br />
            In that you’ll learn your 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th flame colour, how they affect each other and most importantly your own strength and weaknesses.
