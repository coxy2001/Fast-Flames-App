            You’re highest in TWO colours - orange and clear.
            <br />
            <br />
            These are two very different natures and you’ve got both in you.
            <br />
            <br />
            The orange suggests you’re creative, a big picture thinker, fun loving and positive, while the clear suggests you are strong on details and deadline.
            <br />
            <br />
            This is a great combination because it involves both the head and the heart when communicating, but it does indicate that your answers to questions can be …shall we say…. long?
            <br />
            <br />
            You love fixing things, correcting things and spend a fair chunk of time in the spotlight, exciting and delighting other people.
            <br />
            <br />
            Which one is the strongest in you and how does the relationship between the two colours affect your
            day to day communication - and life - professionally and personally?
            <br />
            <br />
            Please bear in mind that this is only a quick quiz, and your results may differ when you do the full
            flames assessment. In that you’ll learn your 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th flame colour, how they affect each
            other and most importantly your own strength and weaknesses.
