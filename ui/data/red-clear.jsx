            You’re highest in TWO colours - red and clear.
            <br />
            <br />
            These are two very different natures and you’ve got both in you.
            <br />
            <br />
            The red suggests you’re direct, fair and very competitive, while the clear suggests you are strong on details and deadlines.
            <br />
            <br />
            This is a great combination because both natures are ‘head’ natures, meaning that you’re a thinker, able to make clear decisions and can be incredibly professional.
            <br />
            <br />
            However, sometimes these colours can be seen as a bit ‘unfeeling’ and ‘hard’, but really? Isn’t that someone else’s problem?
            <br />
            <br />
            Which one is the strongest in you and how does the relationship between the two colours affect your
            day to day communication - and life - professionally and personally?
            <br />
            <br />
            Please bear in mind that this is only a quick quiz, and your results may differ when you do the full
            flames assessment. In that you’ll learn your 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th flame colour, how they affect each
            other and most importantly your own strength and weaknesses.
